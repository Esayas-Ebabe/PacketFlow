Meek-client.exe is an executable file associated with the Tor Browser Bundle, which is developed by The Tor Project, and it is specifically designed to facilitate anonymous internet browsing by routing traffic through the Tor network. The version 8.5.5 of this software includes the meek transport, which is a pluggable transport that helps users bypass censorship by disguising Tor traffic as regular HTTPS traffic. Generally, meek-client.exe is considered safe if downloaded from the official Tor Project website, as it is a legitimate component of the Tor Browser. However, users should remain vigilant and ensure they are not downloading the file from untrustworthy sources, as malware can sometimes disguise itself under similar filenames. Some users may encounter errors related to meek-client.exe, such as connectivity issues or problems with the Tor network, but these are typically not indicative of malware; instead, they often arise from network configurations or temporary server issues. Overall, when used correctly and sourced properly, meek-client.exe serves as a valuable tool for enhancing online privacy and circumventing internet restrictions.
